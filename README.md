## About the Project

This project focuses on predicting the condition of a machine using a *Random Forest Classifier*. The model analyzes important machine parameters such as temperature, vibration level, oil quality, RPM, and other features to estimate whether a machine is in good condition, needs maintenance, or might fail soon.

This approach can help improve maintenance planning and avoid unexpected machine breakdowns, which is especially useful in mechanical and industrial environments.

## Getting Started

To run this project on your system, make sure to install the required Python libraries first.

### Step 1: Install Required Packages

Open a terminal or command prompt in your project directory and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the dependencies needed for the code to work.

## Input Files for Prediction

You will need some data files to test the machine condition prediction model. These files contain various sensor readings from machines. Make sure the data follows the same format used during training, including features like:

* Temperature
* Vibration
* Oil Quality
* RPM
* Load
* And other relevant parameters

## How It Works

1. The trained Random Forest model reads the input data.
2. It processes the values using decision trees.
3. The final prediction tells the expected condition of the machine.

This helps users decide if the machine is working fine or if it requires immediate attention.

## Conclusion

This project gave me an opportunity to apply data analysis concepts in a practical mechanical engineering context. I learned how machine data can be used to train predictive models, which can be very useful in real-world maintenance systems.
